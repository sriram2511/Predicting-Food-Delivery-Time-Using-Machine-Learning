# Food Delivery Time Prediction
## Abstract

The food delivery industry has experienced significant growth over the last decade, with online ordering and delivery witnessing a 300 percent faster growth than dine-in visitation since 2014. This study aims to predict the time taken for food delivery using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset includes parameters such as the type of order, type of vehicle, vehicle condition, festival season, multiple deliveries, weather condition, road traffic intensity, and city. The objective is to analyze this data to train machine learning models and accurately predict delivery times, enabling food delivery companies to optimize routes and enhance their services.

I. Introduction

Food delivery services have revolutionized the traditional way of delivering food, providing convenience and speed to consumers. With the increasing demand, this study focuses on predicting delivery times to further improve service efficiency and customer satisfaction.

II. Objective

The objective is to analyze a large dataset and predict food delivery times using machine learning algorithms. Various parameters, including traffic conditions, distance, and the condition of the delivery vehicle, are considered as independent variables impacting the delivery time. The goal is to train machine learning models to make accurate predictions, aiding food delivery companies in optimizing routes and improving services.
 
 III. Methodology

    Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Historical data is cleaned and preprocessed by removing missing or irrelevant data. The data is formatted for easy visualization and analysis.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations such as Plot 1, Plot 2, Plot 3, Plot 4, Plot 5, and Plot 6 are created to identify patterns and trends in the data, gaining insights into the relationship between different features and the time variable.

    Model Creation: Classification models, including Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbour Regressor, Ridge Regressor, Lasso Regressor, and Random Forest Regression, are created based on conclusions drawn from visualized data.

    Training and Testing: Models are trained and tested using historical data, and their performance is evaluated using various metrics.


IV. Conclusion

This approach involves thorough exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and preprocessing, leading to the creation of multiple regression models. Random Forest Regression emerges as the best-performing model with an accuracy score of 76%. This model is selected for further analysis, providing a comprehensive way to gain insights into the relationship between different features and food delivery times.
